            <p>
                This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. 
                In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath 
                that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, 
                Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>.  
                To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.
